DESCRIPTION					   *SearchSpecial-description*

The built-in search via |/|, |n|, and |N| does its job. But sometimes, it
would be nice to have a custom search that is limited to a certain range, or
the first match in a line, or certain syntax groups, or a search that doesn't
open folds. This plugin offers generic functions that can be used to easily
build such custom search mappings for special searches. A predicate function
can specify which matches are skipped, and options control the behavior with
regards to folding and jumps.

SEE ALSO								     *

The following custom searches use this plugin:

SearchAlternateStar:	    Alternate star "*" search for the word nearest to
			    the cursor.
SearchAsQuickJump:	    Quick search without affecting 'hlsearch', search
			    pattern and history.
SearchFoldsWithoutOpening:  Show search results in closed folds without
			    opening them.
SearchForExpr:		    Search where pattern matches and a passed
			    expression evaluates to true.
SearchInSyntax:		    Skip matches in a particular syntax item when
			    jumping to the next search result.
SearchLineOnce:		    Skip multiple matches in a line when jumping to
			    the next search result.
SearchWithoutClosedFolds:   Skip closed folds when jumping to the next search
			    result.

==============================================================================
USAGE							 *SearchSpecial-usage*

This plugin defines several functions. The following is an overview; you'll
find the details directly in the implementation files in the .vim/autoload/
directory.

SearchSpecial#SearchWithout( searchPattern, isBackward, Predicate, predicateId, predicateDescription, count, ... )

The main helper function that jumps to the next match of a:searchPattern,
skipping all those matches where a:Predicate returns false.

==============================================================================
EXAMPLE						       *SearchSpecial-example*

Here's a simple search mapping that emulates the default search (because it
doesn't pass a predicate that limits the matches, nor are there any options): >
    nnoremap <silent> ,n
    \   :<C-u>if SearchSpecial#SearchWithout(@/, 0, '', 'default', '', v:count1)<Bar>
    \   if &hlsearch<Bar>set hlsearch<Bar>endif<Bar>
    \   else<Bar>echoerr ingo#err#Get()<Bar>endif<CR>
The 'hlsearch' handling cannot be done in a function; and any "Pattern not
found" error is raised directly from the mapping; that's the boilerplate code
at the end of the mapping.

==============================================================================
INSTALLATION					  *SearchSpecial-installation*

This script is packaged as a |vimball|. If you have the "gunzip" decompressor
in your PATH, simply edit the *.vmb.gz package in Vim; otherwise, decompress
the archive first, e.g. using WinZip. Inside Vim, install by sourcing the
vimball or via the |:UseVimball| command. >
    vim SearchSpecial*.vmb.gz
    :so %
To uninstall, use the |:RmVimball| command.

DEPENDENCIES					  *SearchSpecial-dependencies*

- Requires Vim 7.0 or higher.
- Requires the |ingo-library.vim| plugin (vimscript #4433), version 1.019 or
  higher.
